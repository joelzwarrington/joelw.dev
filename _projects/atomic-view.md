Component library built for [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) with first-class support for [ActionView](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html) using [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/).

## Leading principles

1. Work with Ruby on Rails out of the box by supporting ActionView and it's helpers
2. Build with accessibility and responsiveness at the forefront
3. Provide really good defaults, but allow flexibility with theming and styling
